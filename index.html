          Madison Blackstone is a director of brand marketing, with experience
          managing global teams and multi-million-dollar campaigns. Her
          background in brand strategy, visual design, and account management
          inform her mindful but competitive approach. Madison is fueled by her
          passion for understanding the nuances of cross-cultural advertising.
          She considers herself a ‘forever student,’ eager to both build on her
          academic foundations in psychology and sociology and stay in tune with
          the latest digital marketing strategies through continued coursework.
          Her hunger for knowledge and determination to turn information into
          action has contributed to her most recent success at Rockwell Group,
          where she led international, award-winning campaigns for heavy-hitting
          brands, such as Puma, Gucci, and Rolex. Meanwhile, she vastly improved
          the productivity of her team by implementing strategic project
          management methods and ensuring a work-life balance for her
          department. Madison believes mindfulness in the workplace is key to
          success - a tenet she lives out through her interests in yoga,
          meditation, gardening, and painting. Madison is currently working as a
          freelance marketing director and is always interested in a challenge.
